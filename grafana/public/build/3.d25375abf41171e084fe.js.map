Flot plugin for showing crosshairs when the mouse hovers over the plot.\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2007-2014 IOLA and Ole Laursen.\r\nLicensed under the MIT license.\r\n\r\nThe plugin supports these options:\r\n\r\n\tcrosshair: {\r\n\t\tmode: null or \"x\" or \"y\" or \"xy\"\r\n\t\tcolor: color\r\n\t\tlineWidth: number\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nSet the mode to one of \"x\", \"y\" or \"xy\". The \"x\" mode enables a vertical\r\ncrosshair that lets you trace the values on the x axis, \"y\" enables a\r\nhorizontal crosshair and \"xy\" enables them both. \"color\" is the color of the\r\ncrosshair (default is \"rgba(170, 0, 0, 0.80)\"), \"lineWidth\" is the width of\r\nthe drawn lines (default is 1).\r\n\r\nThe plugin also adds four public methods:\r\n\r\n  - setCrosshair( pos )\r\n\r\n    Set the position of the crosshair. Note that this is cleared if the user\r\n    moves the mouse. \"pos\" is in coordinates of the plot and should be on the\r\n    form { x: xpos, y: ypos } (you can use x2/x3/... if you're using multiple\r\n    axes), which is coincidentally the same format as what you get from a\r\n    \"plothover\" event. If \"pos\" is null, the crosshair is cleared.\r\n\r\n  - clearCrosshair()\r\n\r\n    Clear the crosshair.\r\n\r\n  - lockCrosshair(pos)\r\n\r\n    Cause the crosshair to lock to the current location, no longer updating if\r\n    the user moves the mouse. Optionally supply a position (passed on to\r\n    setCrosshair()) to move it to.\r\n\r\n    Example usage:\r\n\r\n\tvar myFlot = $.plot( $(\"#graph\"), ..., { crosshair: { mode: \"x\" } } };\r\n\t$(\"#graph\").bind( \"plothover\", function ( evt, position, item ) {\r\n\t\tif ( item ) {\r\n\t\t\t// Lock the crosshair to the data point being hovered\r\n\t\t\tmyFlot.lockCrosshair({\r\n\t\t\t\tx: item.datapoint[ 0 ],\r\n\t\t\t\ty: item.datapoint[ 1 ]\r\n\t\t\t});\r\n\t\t} else {\r\n\t\t\t// Return normal crosshair operation\r\n\t\t\tmyFlot.unlockCrosshair();\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t});\r\n\r\n  - unlockCrosshair()\r\n\r\n    Free the crosshair to move again after locking it.\r\n*/\r\n\r\n(function ($) {\r\n    var options = {\r\n        crosshair: {\r\n            mode: null, // one of null, \"x\", \"y\" or \"xy\",\r\n            color: \"rgba(170, 0, 0, 0.80)\",\r\n            lineWidth: 1\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    function init(plot) {\r\n        // position of crosshair in pixels\r\n        var crosshair = { x: -1, y: -1, locked: false };\r\n\r\n        plot.setCrosshair = function setCrosshair(pos) {\r\n            if (!pos)\r\n                crosshair.x = -1;\r\n            else {\r\n                var o = plot.p2c(pos);\r\n                crosshair.x = Math.max(0, Math.min(o.left, plot.width()));\r\n                crosshair.y = Math.max(0, Math.min(o.top, plot.height()));\r\n            }\r\n            \r\n            plot.triggerRedrawOverlay();\r\n        };\r\n        \r\n        plot.clearCrosshair = plot.setCrosshair;

This also holds for the start\r\nand end of the chart. Note that stacking a mix of positive and negative values\r\nin most instances doesn't make sense (so it looks weird).\r\n\r\nTwo or more series are stacked when their \"stack\" attribute is set to the same\r\nkey (which can be any number or string or just \"true\"). To specify the default\r\nstack, you can set the stack option like this:\r\n\r\n    series: {\r\n        stack: null/false, true, or a key (number/string)\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou can also specify it for a single series, like this:\r\n\r\n    $.plot( $(\"#placeholder\"), [{\r\n        data: [ ... ],\r\n        stack: true\r\n    }])\r\n\r\nThe stacking order is determined by the order of the data series in the array\r\n(later series end up on top of the previous).\r\n\r\nInternally, the plugin modifies the datapoints in each series, adding an\r\noffset to the y value. For line series, extra data points are inserted through\r\ninterpolation. If there's a second y value, it's also adjusted (e.g for bar\r\ncharts or filled areas).\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\n(function ($) {\r\n    var options = {\r\n        series: { stack: null } // or number/string\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    function init(plot) {\r\n        function findMatchingSeries(s, allseries) {\r\n            var res = null;\r\n            for (var i = 0;

For \"xy\", the selection becomes a rectangle where both ranges can be\r\nspecified. \"color\" is color of the selection (if you need to change the color\r\nlater on, you can get to it with plot.getOptions().selection.color). \"shape\"\r\nis the shape of the corners of the selection.\r\n\r\n\"minSize\" is the minimum size a selection can be in pixels. This value can\r\nbe customized to determine the smallest size a selection can be and still\r\nhave the selection rectangle be displayed. When customizing this value, the\r\nfact that it refers to pixels, not axis units must be taken into account.\r\nThus, for example, if there is a bar graph in time mode with BarWidth set to 1\r\nminute, setting \"minSize\" to 1 will not make the minimum selection size 1\r\nminute, but rather 1 pixel. Note also that setting \"minSize\" to 0 will prevent\r\n\"plotunselected\" events from being fired when the user clicks the mouse without\r\ndragging.\r\n\r\nWhen selection support is enabled, a \"plotselected\" event will be emitted on\r\nthe DOM element you passed into the plot function. The event handler gets a\r\nparameter with the ranges selected on the axes, like this:\r\n\r\n\tplaceholder.bind( \"plotselected\", function( event, ranges ) {\r\n\t\talert(\"You selected \" + ranges.xaxis.from + \" to \" + ranges.xaxis.to)\r\n\t\t// similar for yaxis - with multiple axes, the extra ones are in\r\n\t\t// x2axis, x3axis, ...\r\n\t});\r\n\r\nThe \"plotselected\" event is only fired when the user has finished making the\r\nselection. A \"plotselecting\" event is fired during the process with the same\r\nparameters as the \"plotselected\" event, in case you want to know what's\r\nhappening while it's happening,\r\n\r\nA \"plotunselected\" event with no arguments is emitted when the user clicks the\r\nmouse to remove the selection. As stated above, setting \"minSize\" to 0 will\r\ndestroy this behavior.\r\n\r\nThe plugin allso adds the following methods to the plot object:\r\n\r\n- setSelection( ranges, preventEvent )\r\n\r\n  Set the selection rectangle. The passed in ranges is on the same form as\r\n  returned in the \"plotselected\" event. If the selection mode is \"x\", you\r\n  should put in either an xaxis range, if the mode is \"y\" you need to put in\r\n  an yaxis range and both xaxis and yaxis if the selection mode is \"xy\", like\r\n  this:\r\n\r\n\tsetSelection({ xaxis: { from: 0, to: 10 }, yaxis: { from: 40, to: 60 } });\r\n\r\n  setSelection will trigger the \"plotselected\" event when called. If you don't\r\n  want that to happen, e.g. if you're inside a \"plotselected\" handler, pass\r\n  true as the second parameter. If you are using multiple axes, you can\r\n  specify the ranges on any of those, e.g. as x2axis/x3axis/... instead of\r\n  xaxis, the plugin picks the first one it sees.\r\n\r\n- clearSelection( preventEvent )\r\n\r\n  Clear the selection rectangle. Pass in true to avoid getting a\r\n  \"plotunselected\" event.\r\n\r\n- getSelection()\r\n\r\n  Returns the current selection in the same format as the \"plotselected\"\r\n  event. If there's currently no selection, the function returns null.\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\n(function ($) {\r\n    function init(plot) {\r\n        var selection = {\r\n                first: { x: -1, y: -1}, second: { x: -1, y: -1},\r\n                show: false,\r\n                active: false\r\n            };\r\n\r\n        // FIXME: The drag handling implemented here should be\r\n        // abstracted out, there's some similar code from a library in\r\n        // the navigation plugin, this should be massaged a bit to fit\r\n        // the Flot cases here better and reused.

of fullsize, or a specified pixel length, or 'auto'\r\n\t\t\tinnerRadius: 0-1 for percentage of fullsize or a specified pixel length, for creating a donut effect\r\n\t\t\tstartAngle: 0-2 factor of PI used for starting angle (in radians) i.e 3/2 starts at the top, 0 and 2 have the same result\r\n\t\t\ttilt: 0-1 for percentage to tilt the pie, where 1 is no tilt, and 0 is completely flat (nothing will show)\r\n\t\t\toffset: {\r\n\t\t\t\ttop: integer value to move the pie up or down\r\n\t\t\t\tleft: integer value to move the pie left or right, or 'auto'\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\tstroke: {\r\n\t\t\t\tcolor: any hexidecimal color value (other formats may or may not work, so best to stick with something like '#FFF')\r\n\t\t\t\twidth: integer pixel width of the
